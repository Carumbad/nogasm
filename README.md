###Vibrator
The vibrator is made from a Mabuchi RS-555PH motor, with an eccentric mass pressed onto the shaft. These can be purchased pre-assembled, or built from the motor and some .88" to 1" diameter cylindrical brass stock.
The vibrator case is designed to be compatible with attachments designed for the Hitachi Magic Wand. The motor is press-fit or glued into the two halves of the case.
